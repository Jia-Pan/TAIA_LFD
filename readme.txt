Hello!

The report and the code are both included in the notebook.

Before running the notebook we suggest you install the necessary packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

If after installing the packages you're getting an error on the image part of the notebook,
please run:
    conda install python-graphviz
    
Thank you!
